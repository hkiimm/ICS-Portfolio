      This is a program that I wrote for my ICS3UF final project. It is an application that allows the user
      to purchase tickets for a theatre that's 20 x 30. It has the option to buy tickets, view the seating plan, and reset
      the seating plan. The code for this program can be found <a href = "https://github.com/hkiimm/ICS3UF" target = "blank">here.</a>

    <h3>APPLICATION<h3>
      <p>
        This application would store and keep track of all the clothing items you own. Basically it would be a virtual closet.
        It could keep track of any new purchases that you should start wearing, or it would tell you to donate any clothes that
        you haven't worn over the last year. You would be able to customize features such as how minimalistic you want to keep your
        closet, and what types of items you like to purchase. If you need to attend an event, and you need a certain item, it would
        browse stores that sell the article that you need. If you liked certain brands, such as nike, it would alert you whenever
        this brand is having a sale, or the item you're looking for is one sale. This would help you budget and save money. This
        application would be for people who like to buy clothes, hoard clothes (like me), or are just very disorganized. It would help
        you choose outfits in the morning or for special ocassions, so you don't have to stand in front of your closet thinking, "Why
        do I have no clothes?" This application would be helpful to keep people organized.
